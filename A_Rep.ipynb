        "\n",
        "* A* is a smart pathfinding algorithm used to find the **shortest path** in a weighted graph.\n",
        "* It uses two values:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **g(n):** Actual cost to reach a node from the start.\n",
        "  * **h(n):** Estimated cost (heuristic) from that node to the goal.\n",
        "* It combines them:\n",
        "  [\n",
        "  f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n",
        "  ]\n",

        "### Our Example (Graph of Campuses)\n",
        "\n",
        "* We have campuses (A–F).\n",
        "* Each connection has a **distance (km)**.\n",

        "3. **A * Function:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * `open_list` → a priority queue (heap) to store nodes by their `f` value.\n",
        "   * `g_costs` → dictionary storing best known actual cost from start.\n",
